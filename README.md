# Violent Supply/Demand
A look at violence and video games and any correlation, mainly looking at whether video games contribute to creating violence or simply supply an outlet to a societal demand.

# Theme  
This experiment seeks to explore the fabled correlation between video games and violence in real world scenarios, by combining both in a single interface. 
The hope is to explore the violent shock factor and whether users are numbed to the violence inherent to the created interface. 
This interface design was inspired by art by Joseph DeLappe in which he attaches pencils or brushes to a mouse to draw on a canvas under the mouse, 
tracking the mouse's movement and using it to create art.

# Mechanics  
The user will interact with a game, either violent or peaceful, but with the addition of a knife attached to the mouse. A cut of meat (or bread in the case of this student-budget prototype) will be firmly suspended in front of the mouse. 
The game will feature a core mechanic requiring the user to thrust the mouse forwards in order to progress or succeed, causing them to physically stab the mouse-knife into the meat. 

# Aims  
The goal of this experiment is to engage with this idea of video game violence by implementing a physical aspect of violence. In the case of a violent video game, 
this might drive home the violence contained within the boundaries of the virtual world by correlating it to a physical consequence. On the flip side, with the casual farming simulator game, 
it will serve to test whether this 'video game violence' numbs users to its presence, whether they can focus on the soothing aspects of the game
or are drawn to the violence physically before them. The intention then is to subvert the virtually-contained video game qualities by bringing them to a physical dimension and present the user with this. 

# Aesthetics
The aesthetics of the software will consist of simple shapes and png images. As the focus of this is not to create a best-selling game but more to investigate the correlation between the concurrent virtual and physical violence, there is no need to
utilise software like Unity or Unreal to create a fully-developed game. Only enough needs to be there to engage with the player for a while as they experience the violence from their mouse movements, which is why the choice to go with p5.js has been made. 
This allows for a far simpler visual experience that can be built from the ground up. 

# Technology 
The experiment will consist of a standard computer set-up with a mouse and keyboard with the addition of a contraption attaching a knife coming off the front of the mouse. 
A cut of meat will be suspended firmly in front of the mouse above a bowl to catch any juices. The final virtual component will consist of two rudimentary games, 
one inherently violent and one devoid of violence, though the prototype consists of a single violent game. These will be created using p5.js coding.
