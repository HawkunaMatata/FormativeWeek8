# Violent Supply/Demand
A look at violence and video games and any correlation, mainly looking at whether video games contribute to creating violence or simply supply an outlet to a societal demand. 

# Theme  
This experiment seeks to explore the fabled correlation between video games and violence in real world scenarios, by combining both in a single interface. The hope is to explore the violent shock factor and whether users are numbed to the violence inherent to the 
created interface. 
This interface design was inspired by art by Joseph DeLappe in which he attaches pencils or brushes to a mouse to draw on a canvas under the mouse, tracking the mouse's movement and using it to create art. ![DeLappe Mouse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/64b90e355ad38d2e2aa886cf/a7b531d0-7a47-4f76-a683-cb4999930f5f/Artist%27s+Mouse.jpg?format=1000w) 

# Mechanics  
The user will interact with a game, either violent or peaceful, but with the addition of a knife attached to the mouse. A cut of meat will be firmly suspended in front of the mouse. The game will feature some core mechanic requiring the user to thrust
the mouse forwards in order to progress or succeed, causing them to physically stab the mouse-knife into the meat. 

# Aims  
The goal of this experiment is to engage with this idea of video game violence by implementing a physical aspect of violence. In the case of a violent video game, this might drive home the violence contained within the boundaries of the virtual world
by correlating it to a physical consequence. On the flip side, with the casual farming simulator game, it will serve to test whether this 'video game violence' numbs users to its presence, whether they can focus on the soothing aspects of the game or are
drawn to the violence physically before them. 

# Aesthetics
The aesthetics will be within the limits of the software used, i.e. if p5.js is used, aesthetics will be limited to simple shapes and pixels drawings, with greater possibilities in Unity or Unreal. 

# Technology 
The experiment will consist of a standard computer set-up with a mouse and keyboard with the addition of a contraption attaching a knife coming off the front of the mouse. A cut of meat will be suspended firmly in front of the mouse aobve a bowl to catch
any juices. The virtual component will consist of two rudimentary games, one inherently violent and one devoid of violence. These might be created using p5.js or with the assistance of a game engine such as Unity or Unreal.
