# Violent Supply/Demand
A look at violence and video games and any correlation, mainly looking at whether video games contribute to creating violence or simply supply an outlet to a societal demand.

# Mechanics  
The user will interact with either game, one violent and one peaceful, but with the addition of a knife attached to the mouse. A cut of meat (or bread in the case of this student-budget project) will be firmly suspended in front of the mouse.

Both games feature a core mechanic requiring the user to thrust the mouse forwards quickly in order to progress or succeed, causing them to physically stab the mouse-knife into the meat. In the violent game, the objective is to raise your score by stabbing the innocent smiley face quickly, as your score will decrease as long as your cursor is above the line. Ideally then, the player will hover the cursor below the line, and then thrust it forwards and back to stab the smiley and quickly return to below the line, maximising score. Naturally, this will cause them to physically stab the mouse-knife into the meat/bread. 

In the farming game, the objective is to pluck the tomatoes from the vine and retrieve them below the line. However, there is a wasp which is on patrol and will sting your arm causing you to lose points if it makes contact. Therefore the game rewards quick movements forwards to reach the tomatoes and then pull the arm and tomato back to safety beneath the line for maximum points. Similarly, this will cause the player to stab the mouse-knife into the meat/bread in a very different context.
